Login to Amazon web services:
    1. Create a key pair name and via .pem file, download it, then drag it into vscode.
    2. Set up security groups with these inbound rules:
        Custom TCP TCP 8080 0.0.0.0/0
        SSH TCP 22 71.179.18.117/32
        HTTPS TCP 443 0.0.0.0/0
        HTTP TCP 80 0.0.0.0/0
    3. Launch an instance then copy over the public ipv4 dns address

Configure the .pem file with this command:
    scp -i path/to/your-key.pem path/to/your-backend.jar ec2-user@<your-public-ip>:/home/ec2-user/

1. Go to application.properties and get rid of the database related lines
2. Go to .env and replace REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL with the public ipv4 dns address
3. Rebuild the frontend with npm run build
4. sftp into the frontend server for terpconnect -> sftp zliang14@terpconnect.umd.edu
5. Go to the cd ../pub/gogame, then put -r build/* .
6. ssh into the backend server for ec2 ssh -i path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-public-address-ipv4
6. execute the jar file
