## About the Project

WeiQi (Go) is a famous historical Chinese board game, played on standard 9x9, 13x13, or 19x19 boards (Goban) with the goal of capturing more territory than your opponent.
This web app simulates real-time gameplay against AI agents with 5 difficulty levels, ranging from beginner to professional level play.

üìú Inspired by *"Deep Learning and the Game of Go"* by Max Pumperla & Kevin Ferguson and AlphaZero https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01815

## AI Agent Difficulty Levels

|  Bot Name         |  Difficulty Level         |  Algorithm / Description |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| `BeginnerBot`      | üü¢ Beginner (30‚Äì20k)         | Random legal moves only. No strategy. |
| `AlphaBetaBot`     | üü° Double Digit Kyu (19‚Äì10k) | Alpha-Beta Pruning with capturing heuristic. |
| `MonteCarloBot`    | üîµ Single Digit Kyu (9‚Äì1k)   | Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). |
| `DeepNeuralBot`    | üü£ Low Dan (1‚Äì7d)            | Deep Neural Network + Search (Planned). |
| `VisionLangBot`    | üî¥ High Dan (1‚Äì9p)           | Vision-Language Model + Search (Planned). |

### BeginnerBot
- Picks a random legal move.
- No evaluation performed.

### AlphaBetaBot
- Uses Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning.
- Evaluates moves by:
  - Exploring move trees to a fixed depth.
  - Prioritizing moves that capture opponent stones.
  - Avoiding unproductive branches via pruning.

### MonteCarloBot
- Uses MCTS with the 4-step process:
  1. **Selection:** Traverse using UCT.
  2. **Expansion:** Add new random child node.
  3. **Simulation:** Roll out games with BeginnerBot.
  4. **Backpropagation:** Update stats recursively.
- Selects move with highest win rate after the rollouts.

### DeepNeuralBot (Planned)
- CNN or GNN-based evaluation.
- Faster search via heuristic guidance.

### VisionLangBot (Planned)
- Vision-Language model to understand patterns.
- Paired with classical search (e.g., MCTS, Alpha-Beta).
- Intended to simulate professional play quality.
